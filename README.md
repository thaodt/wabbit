# twabbit

My Rust implementation for [Wabbit programming language](https://www.dabeaz.com/wabbit.html) when joining the great course **["Writing a Compiler"](https://www.dabeaz.com/compiler.html)** from David Beazley.

Note: There are no course materials here, just include some Wabbit programs to be used for tests.

Happy Coding! :heart:
